## how to convert decimal to binary

- Write down the decimal number.
- Divide the number by 2.
- Write the result underneath.
- Write the remainder on the right hand side. This will be 0 or 1.
- Divide the result of the division by 2 and again write down the remainder.
- Continue dividing and writing down remainders until the result of the division is 0.
- The most significant bit (MSB) is at the bottom of the column of remainders and the least significant 
  bit (LSB) is at the top.
- Read the series of 1s and 0s on the right from the bottom up. This is the binary equivalent of the 
  decimal number.
