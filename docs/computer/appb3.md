- **Latch**门闩: A memory element for which output is equal to the value of the stored state inside the element and for 
  which the internal state is changed whenever the appropriate inputs change.

- **Flip-flop**: A memory element for which output is equal to the value of the stored state inside the element and for 
  which the internal state is changed only on a clock edge.

- intput of R is 0, output from R is 1, output 1 send back to the bottom
- output from S is 0

- R(reset) pulses ON
