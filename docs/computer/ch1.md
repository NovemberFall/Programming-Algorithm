  - Battery operated
  - Connects to the Internet
  - Hundreds of dollars
  - Smart phones, tablets, electronic glasses

- Cloud computing
  - Warehouse Scale Computers (WSC)
  - Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - Portion of software run on a PMD and a portion run in the Cloud

1)
- While previously true, computer advances have led to emphasis instead on parallel processors 
  and hierarchical memory, which will be introduced later.
- The amount of memory on computers has increased. So essentally, that what currently is 
  emphasized by programmers is using parallel processing in terms of trading. So using 
  the least amount of memory is not any more nowadays critcial for focus on performance.


4)
- false, A single processor can indeed switch between programs to support running multiple 
  programs seemingly in parallel. However, these programs are actually run one at a time. 
  A multicore microprocessor has multiple processors on a single chip, and thus can truly 
  run programs in parallel, leading to faster performance.
  - when you have multiple processor that that's not single processor. it's basically 
    equivalent having many processes.

5)
- false, 
  - Acronym(首字母缩写): A word constructed by taking the initial letters of a string of words. 
    For example: RAM is an acronym for Random Access Memory, and CPU is an acronym for 
    Central Processing Unit.
