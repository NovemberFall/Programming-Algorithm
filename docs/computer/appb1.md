## 8.3 Combinational logic

- A **circuit** is a connection of electrical components

- A **digital circuit** has components that transform digital signals, which are signals that take on only one of a few 
  specific values, like 0 and 1.

- A **combinational circuit** is a digital circuit whose output values depend solely on the present combination of 
  input values (past input values do not matter).

- A combinational circuit can be built from components like AND, OR, and NOT gates, known as **logic gates**.

```
B.7 [10] <COD §§B.2, B.3> Construct the truth table for a four-input odd-parity function 
(see COD Section B.9 (Memory elements: SRAMs and DRAMs) for a description of parity).
